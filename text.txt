TASK BRIEF – SFM Product & Store Sharing + App Links Objective Implement product sharing and seller store sharing in the SFM Flutter app using standard HTTPS links, Android App Links, and iOS Universal Links, with login enforced only on actions, not on page views. Firebase Dynamic Links must NOT be used. 1. Link Structure (MANDATORY) Product URLs https://salonefastmarket.com/product/{slug}-{id} Seller Store URLs https://salonefastmarket.com/store/{store-slug} These links must: Open in browser if app is not installed Open directly inside the app if installed Be shareable via WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook, etc. 2. Flutter App Requirements Required Packages share_plus url_launcher app_links 3. Sharing Features (Flutter) Product Sharing Add a Share button on product detail pages Use share_plus to share: Product name Price Product URL Seller Store Sharing Add Share Store in: Seller profile page Seller dashboard Share store URL using share_plus WhatsApp Direct Share Optional button using wa.me + url_launcher 4. Deep Linking (CRITICAL) Flutter Use app_links to listen for incoming links Route: /product/* → ProductDetailsPage /store/* → StorePage DO NOT: Redirect deep links to login Block product/store pages for guests 5. Login Rules (STRICT) Action Login Required View product NO View store NO Share links NO Add to cart YES Buy YES Chat seller YES Seller dashboard YES Post-Login Redirect If user opens a shared link and logs in, they must be returned to that same product or store page. 6. Android App Links Setup AndroidManifest.xml Add intent filters for: https://salonefastmarket.com/product https://salonefastmarket.com/store Backend Create: https://salonefastmarket.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json Include: App package name Release SHA-256 fingerprint 7. iOS Universal Links Setup Backend Create: https://salonefastmarket.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association Support paths: /product/* /store/* iOS App Enable Associated Domains Add: applinks:salonefastmarket.com 8. Backend Requirements (NON-OPTIONAL) Open Graph Metadata All product and store pages must include: og:title og:description og:image og:url This is required for WhatsApp and Facebook previews. 9. Success Criteria Shared links open correctly in app or web WhatsApp shows product image and details App does NOT force login on open Login happens only on protected actions After login, user returns to original link 10. Explicit Constraints ❌ Firebase Dynamic Links ❌ Login wall on deep link open ❌ Private product/store pages ❌ Link shorteners ✅ Standard HTTPS links ✅ App Links / Universal Links ✅ Action-based authentication If anything above is unclear, implementation must follow mobile commerce best practices, not shortcuts.



i am using flutter web app at salonefastmarket.com/app and salonefastmarket.com contains the landing page plain html
Deep links should map directly to feature screens, not app shell routes.
but they should be unique and seo friendly

i do not have access to ios 
i have full control of the domain
i do not know the images are public i will make sure
if no product image exists just use the apps logo
yes use the first iamge
i wan to use seller product screen with all info and prouducts
navigate to loginscreen itself App:
* Saves current route + parameters
* Navigates to `LoginScreen`
* After successful login:
   * Return user to exact same screen & state
   * Continue intended action

yes i cna modify the backend
iUse full Express routes that fetch from MongoDB and render HTML
* Let Open Graph do the marketing
* Share text stays clean and universal
✅ Recommended Behavior (Industry Standard)
Flow
1. Show a skeleton loader while fetching
2. If API returns 404 / null:
   * Show “Product Not Found” screen
   * Provide clear actions
❌ Do NOT redirect immediately to Home
❌ Do NOT show a blank page
❌ Do NOT crash or loop

2. Product Slug Generation
✅ AUTO-GENERATED from product name
App Links + Universal Links (no Firebase Dynamic Links)
no ios mobile link sharing for now
